## Adjacency List

-   Can take up less space (in sparse graphs)
-   Faster to iterate over all edges
-   Can be slower to lookup specific edge

## Adjacency Matrix

-   Takes up more space (in sparse graphs)
-   Slower to iterate over all edges
-   Faster to lookup specific edge

## Tree Treaversal

Visiting/updating/checking every vertex in a graph
