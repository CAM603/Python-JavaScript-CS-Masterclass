# Python | JavaScript - Computer Science Masterclass

A collection of computer science related topics including data structures, algorithms, problem solving and Big O notation...currently in Python and JavaScript.

## Motivation

I created this as a place for myself and others to reference computer science concepts. It also serves as a playground for practicing new languages. There's no better way to practice a language than by implementing data structures, algorithms and solving common code challenges!
