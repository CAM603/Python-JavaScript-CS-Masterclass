Write a function called power which accepts a base and an exponent. The function should return the power of the base to the exponent. This function should mimic the functionality of Math.pow - do not worry about negative bases and exponents

power(2,0) -> 1
power(2,2) -> 4
power(2,4) -> 16

Write a function called factorial which accepts a number and returns the factorial of that number. A factorial is the product of an integer and all the integers below it.

Factorial 4 (written like 4!) equals 24. 
4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24

Factorial zero, 0!, is always 1

Write a function called fib which accepts a number and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is the sequence of whole numbers 1,1,2,3,5,8... which starts with 1 and 1, and where every number thereafter is equal to the sum of the previous two numbers
