# Problem Solving Patterns

-   Frequency Counter
-   Multiple Pointers
-   Sliding Window
-   Divide and Conquer
-   Dynamic Programming
-   Greedy Algorithms
-   Backtracking

## Frequency Counter

-   This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
-   This can often avoid the need for nested loops of O(n^2) operations with arrays/strings
