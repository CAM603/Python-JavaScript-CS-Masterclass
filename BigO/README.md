Examples of functions and their Big O using Python and JavaScript.

How to run the code:

JavaScript:

- Install Quokka (free version works fine)
- command + shift + p
- select Quokka.js Toggle
- any console.log()'s will show up in the editor

Python:

- Install Python for vscode
- Press the green play button to execute code
- Prints will show up in vscode console

# Big O

An algorithm is O(f(n)) if the number of simple operations the computer has to do is eventually less than a constant times f(n) as n increases

- f(n) could be linear (f(n) = n)
- f(n) could be quadratic (f(n) = n^2)
- f(n) could be constant (f(n) = 1)
- f(n) could be something entirely different!

## Counting Operators

- The more operations your computer does, the longer the execution time will be
- Reguardless of the exact number, the number of operations grows roughly
  proportionally with n
